# Skeleton3 Monorepo

Modern full-stack starter that ships with a typed React + Mantine frontend, an Express + tRPC API, and a PostgreSQL database powered by Prisma. The repository demonstrates how to structure a pnpm/Turborepo mono workspace, share code between packages, and automate preview + production deployments with Docker and GitHub Actions. The guide below is formatted so another agent (or future you) can skim, copy/paste, and get productive in seconds.

## TL;DR Checklist

| Task | Command / Location |
| --- | --- |
| Install deps | `pnpm install` |
| Start Postgres | `docker compose up -d db` |
| Generate Prisma client | `pnpm db:generate` |
| Push schema & seed | see [Database bootstrap](#database-bootstrap) |
| Run everything | `pnpm dev` (web on 5173, server on 4000) |
| Type-check | `pnpm lint` |
| Build | `pnpm build` |
| Deploy preview | GitHub Actions ➜ `scripts/deploy-preview.sh` |

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vite, React, TypeScript, Mantine UI, @tanstack/react-query, @trpc/react-query
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, tRPC
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma
- **Tooling:** pnpm workspaces, Turborepo, Docker, GitHub Actions

## Repository Layout

```
apps/
  web/        # React client bootstrapped with Vite + Mantine
  server/     # Express server exposing the tRPC API
packages/
  api/        # Shared tRPC router definitions
  common/     # Types + utilities consumed throughout the monorepo
  db/         # Prisma schema, client, and seed helpers
scripts/
  deploy-preview.sh # Example remote deploy helper triggered by CI
```

Shared TypeScript configuration lives in `tsconfig.base.json`, while `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `turbo.json` orchestrate installs and tasks across the workspace. Each package declares its own scripts, but everything can be driven from the repo root via Turborepo.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm (Corepack enabled is easiest)
- Docker (for local Postgres and production images)

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (Node 20+ recommended):

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start Postgres** locally via Docker:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d db
   ```

3. **Database bootstrap** – copy the env file into the Prisma workspace, generate the client, push schema, seed data. Copy/paste this block anytime you reset the DB:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp .env packages/db/.env
   pnpm db:generate
   pnpm --filter @acme/db db:push
   pnpm --filter @acme/db db:seed
   ```

4. **Run the apps** in parallel using Turborepo (web on `5173`, API on `4000`):

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

Visit http://localhost:5173, sign in with `demo@example.com` / `demo1234`, and explore the authenticated todo dashboard powered by tRPC.

## Common Commands

- `pnpm dev` – runs `apps/web` and `apps/server` concurrently via `turbo dev`
- `pnpm build` – type-checks and builds every workspace target
- `pnpm lint` – type-checks only
- `pnpm db:generate|db:migrate|db:seed` – Prisma helpers

Each package/app also exposes its own scoped scripts (e.g. `pnpm --filter @acme/server dev`).

## Application Features

- **Credential-based auth** – Full sign-up/sign-in/logout flow with hashed passwords, session tokens, and `/auth/me` checks wired through tRPC.
- **Session-aware backend** – Express context inspects `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers, fetches Prisma sessions, and enforces ownership on all todo operations.
- **Rich todo management** – Todos support statuses (Backlog, In Progress, Done), priorities, optional due dates, and are filterable/searchable. Stats cards highlight completion progress for quick triage.
- **Demo-friendly** – Seeding creates a ready-to-use account (`demo@example.com` / `demo1234`) plus a few illustrative todos so you can show off the experience immediately.
- **Responsive, modern UI** – Custom Mantine theme (Inter font, gradients, elevated cards) keeps the dashboard polished on mobile and desktop. Auth, stats, filters, and todos adapt to available space without extra configuration.

## Environment Reference

| Variable | Location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `.env`, `packages/db/.env`, CI secrets | Postgres connection string |
| `WEB_URL` | `.env` | Where the server should allow CORS from (default `http://localhost:5173`) |
| `PORT` | `.env` | API listening port (default `4000`) |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_KEY` | `packages/common` | Frontend storage key for the session token (defaults to `skeleton3.session`) |

Session tokens are generated server-side and returned by the auth routers. The React client stores tokens in `localStorage` and automatically injects them into `Authorization` headers for every tRPC call.

## Deployment Workflow

- **Preview Deployments:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds the repo and runs `scripts/deploy-preview.sh`, which syncs artifacts to a remote host, runs migrations + seed, and boots Dockerized services. Each branch receives a self-contained database and subdomain.
- **Production:** Mirror the preview workflow but point secrets to the production environment. The first deployment provisions the DB; subsequent deploys run migrations only, preserving data.
- **Docker:** `apps/server/Dockerfile` and `apps/web/Dockerfile` build production images. Use them directly or via `docker compose` alongside the Postgres service defined at the repo root.

Feel free to extend this skeleton by adding CI jobs for testing, integrating more packages, or swapping the auth layer. The defaults are intentionally simple so you can move fast while keeping type-safety throughout the stack.
